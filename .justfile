## > `nix develop` - run a bash shell that provides the build environment of a derivation
## The next two commands (`activate` and `deactivate` devshell) are based on the assumption that if $SHLVL > 1 then we're already in a nix interactive development shell. See more discussion in the following two links:
## [1] https://discourse.nixos.org/t/custom-prompts-or-shell-depth-indicator-for-nix-shell-nix-develop/29942
## [2] https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6677

shlvl := env('SHLVL', '-1')
## ^ We have to access the user's SHLVL like this because entering a justfile increments SHLVL

user_shell := env('SHELL', '/bin/sh')
