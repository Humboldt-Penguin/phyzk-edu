## Office Hours

I'm happy to meet with you to go over homework, prepare for upcoming exams, or explain entire concepts from scratch — just shoot me an email.

- **Time** — I'm typically free all of Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. If you really prefer Wednesday/Thursday/Friday, let me know what time specifically, and I can see if I can squeeze you in.

- **Location**...

    - **In-person** — We can meet in the physics building on Busch *([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yA19HSBsptY817fG9){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" })*, or the learning centers on any campus. I live two minutes away from Busch, but I don't mind driving to wherever is easiest for you.

    - **Zoom** — [Join here](https://rutgers.zoom.us/j/8134552847?pwd=SWlOMmlZTm4yV2lDWGdsZFBLM0R2UT09){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }.
