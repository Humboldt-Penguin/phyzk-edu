## Office Hours

I'm happy to meet with you to go over homework, prepare for upcoming exams, or explain entire concepts from scratch — just shoot me an email.

- **Location** — We can talk via Zoom or in-person, whichever you prefer. For in-person, we can meet in the physics building on Busch *([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yA19HSBsptY817fG9))*, or the learning centers on any campus. I live two minutes away from Busch, but I don't mind driving to wherever is easiest for you.

- **Time** — I'm typically free all of Monday, Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday. If you really prefer Wednesday/Thursday/Friday, let me know what time specifically and I can see if I can squeeze you in.
