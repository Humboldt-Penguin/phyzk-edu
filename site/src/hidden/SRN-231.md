## [1] Parking

I suggest you park in Lot 53A, there's always some spots open. Your other option would be parking by the library, but I think that's a little further.

## [3] Finding room 231

1. As soon as you walk in, walk down the hallway on the left.
    - The double-doors might be closed after ~4:30pm, but you can just push past the door on the right.
2. Make the first right (you'll see a mail room on your right just before you turn).
3. SRN-231 will be the second door on your left, right after the kitchen.
