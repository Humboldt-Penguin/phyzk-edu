The purported goal of this lab is to:

1. Teach you how to quantify statistical uncertainties in experiments, both in direct measurements, and values you calculate from those measurements.
2. Introduce you to position sensors, how they work, and their limitations.

In my opinion, this lab fails miserably at those things.

&nbsp;

In the future, I will rewrite this lab completely to focus on curve-fitting.
