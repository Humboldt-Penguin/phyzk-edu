## Videos

When a topic confuses me, I often find it helpful to see how different people explain it. Here are some great resources for that:

1. [Eugene Khutoryansky](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFLPjkE_d7AQhZWGdndTNv_qdxhaghmcv){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }
    - This channel gives amazing intuitive/visual explanations for various physics topics, including E&M.
    - The link above is a ^^playlist of videos related to **circuits**^^ which I've found extremely helpful.
1. [Yau-Jong Twu (YJT)](https://sites.google.com/site/twuphysicslessons/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }
    - Navigate using the left sidebar. Look for tabs starting with "AP 2" or "AP C" *("AP 1" is more related to Gen. Phys. 1)*.
    - Some videos invovle calculus — you can safely ignore that content.
