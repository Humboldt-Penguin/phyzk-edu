## [1] Why Research?

Do you have an "itch" to...
- Dive deep into difficult problems?
- Push the boundaries of your knowledge/curiosity at the cutting-edge of your field?
- Become an expert on a topic you're passionate about?
- Work with ambitious and like-minded professors/scientists/peers?

&nbsp;

Courses are important, but it can take _years_ until you're doing **independent** and **hands-on** work.

!!! note
	**With research, you can scratch that "itch" for learning and discovery — !~no prior experience needed~!, and you get !~paid~!!**

&nbsp;

**Not sure about graduate school? No worries!** Research at Rutgers involves *highly technical work* with *cutting-edge methods/equipment*, on par with advanced junior/senior internships.

Also, depending on your school/major/degree (e.g. SEBS core), you may require "research credits" to graduate — talk to your academic advisor for more information.

### Already involved in research?

While students are conducting research under a professor, Aresty offers:
- [Travel grants for conferences.](https://aresty.rutgers.edu/programs/grants/conference-funding)
- [Funding for research supplies.](https://aresty.rutgers.edu/programs/grants/research-funding)
- [Opportunity and support for publishing in our own peer-reviewed journal (RURJ).](https://aresty.rutgers.edu/aresty-rurj)
- Poster presentation opportunities (typically tied to previous offerings).

## [4] How Can I Be a Competitive Applicant?

NOTE: THIS IS UNFINISHED, CHECK BACK IN A FEW DAYS THANK YOU :)

In the meantime, start developing your skills. A lot of STEM research requires basic programming (reading data files, making plots, etc.), and it's a great way to demonstrate independence, intellectual curiosity, passion, and ambition! Examples:
- read a textbook and post your notes online: https://sites.google.com/view/anish-suresh/mathematics/mathematical-circles?authuser=0
- follow youtube tutorials to make interactive simulations: https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Physics_Simulations


when applications open, read their papers and ask about them

&nbsp;

Even if you get rejected from Aresty, there are many research opportunities at Rutgers, both with the professors in your courses and other research centers/institutes like Aresty. Also, just the process of applying (considering your strengths/weaknesses, crafting your narrative, honing your resume, etc.) significantly improves your chances at

**Also [here's a list of some (not all!) other research opportunities at Rutgers](https://aresty.rutgers.edu/resources/other-programs/summer-research-rutgers) — mark the application dates on your calendar!**
