I distributed [paper copies](./phy203_syllabus_2026-Sp.pdf){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } of the syllabus on the first day of class. Here's a summary:

## [1] Recitation Format & Grading

Each recitation is worth 5 points, and has two "rounds":

| [Work]       | [Time]  | [Groups]   | [Points] | [Notes]      |
| :----------- | :------ | :--------- | :------- | :----------- |
| 3 Worksheets | 60 mins | 2-3 people | 3 points | Open notes   |
| Quiz         | 15 mins | Individual | 2 points | Closed notes |

I give partial credit, but you must write your work *fully* and *clearly*. (1)
{ .annotate }

1. If all work is correct but you made a small calculation error *(e.g. you misread and use $\theta=37 ^\circ$ instead of $47 ^\circ$)*, I do not deduct points — but your work must be written *FULLY* and *CLEARLY*!!!

## [2] Absences & Makeup Policy

- We drop the two lowest recitation grades at the end of the semester. These dropped scores reflect both absences and student performance.
<!-- - If you're absent due to illness or other reasons, then **once** during the semester, you may make-up work in a different section, but it has to be in the *same week*. -->
- If you miss a recitation due to any illness or another valid reason, only ONE makeup will be allowed during the semester, and it must occur within the same instructional week in a different section.
    - You may attend either of the two sections I teach on Wednesday, just shoot me an email beforehand:
        - Section 29: Wednesday, 8:30am – 9:50am, LSH-B116 (Livingston)
        - Section 23: Wednesday, 2:00pm - 3:20pm, FOR-191B (Douglass)
    - If you can't attend either of my sections, you need **prior** email approval from the Recitation Course Assistant, Shumaila Chishti ([sfc62@physics.rutgers.edu](mailto:sfc62@physics.rutgers.edu)). I recommend reaching out to her as soon as you think you'll miss a class, it can take 1-2 days for a response.
