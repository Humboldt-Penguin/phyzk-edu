## Videos

Check out the "Weekly" pages for videos tailored to each weeks' recitation. Most videos come from these two instructors, feel free to browse on your own if you're interested:

1. [Yau-Jong Twu (YJT)](https://sites.google.com/site/twuphysicslessons/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }
    - Tip: Navigate using the left sidebar, but ONLY select topics that say "AP Physics 1" *(i.e. not "AP Physics 2" or "AP Physics C")*.
2. [Viren](https://sites.google.com/view/ap-physics-lectures-virens-vid/ap-physics-mechanics){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }
    - Skip/ignore any content that involves calculus (most videos don't).

1. [2/22] [Here are my AP Physics 1 notes from high school](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MfRsPAS2A1e7dyz-pSSueYD1zQYcO8tN/view){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }.

2. [2/24]: Another recitation instructor for PHY-203 *(and my friend/roommate during undergrad!)* wrote an 11-page ["Quick Review of Algebra"](https://www.anishsuresh.com/teaching/phy203-spring-2026){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } to help his students brush up on algebra skills before the first exam.
