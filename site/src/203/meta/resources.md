Check out the "Weekly" pages for videos tailored to each weeks' recitation.

Most of those videos come from these two instructors, feel free to browse on your own if you're interested:

1. [Yau-Jong Twu (YJT)](https://sites.google.com/site/twuphysicslessons/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }
    - Tip: Navigate using the left sidebar, but ONLY select topics that say "AP Physics 1" *(i.e. not "AP Physics 2" or "AP Physics C")*.
2. [Viren](https://sites.google.com/view/ap-physics-lectures-virens-vid/ap-physics-mechanics){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }
    - Skip/ignore any content that involves calculus (most videos don't).
