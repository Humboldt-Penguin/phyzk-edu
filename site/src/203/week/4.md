## [1] Relevant Equations/Concepts


??? note "Tip: Memorizing Formulae"

    The equation sheet they give you has ~50-100 formulae...? In reality, you only need to memorize 1-5 formulae per unit, tops.

    I'll write necessary equations/concepts in each of these weekly posts.

TODO: Differentiate btwn $\Sigma \vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{a}_{\rm{net}}$

<!-- If an object is moving with speed $v$ and wants to turn along a circle of radius $r$, it must have a *net* acceleration of $\frac{v^2}{r}$ towards the center of the circle. -->


If you *observe* an object moving along a circular path of radius $r$, and it has a constant speed $v$ — then you *know* that the **net** acceleration (the result of one or more physical forces) is $\vec{a}_{\rm{net}}=\frac{v^2}{r}$, pointed towards the center of the circle.

Note: this is an *inference from observation*.


<!-- These two statements are logically/physically equivalent:

- you *observe* an object moving along a circular path of radius $r$, and it has a constant speed $v$
- the **net** acceleration is $\vec{a}_{\rm{net}}=\frac{v^2}{r}$, pointed towards the center of the circle. -->




<!-- Note: this applies even if the object isn't traveling in a complete circle.  -->

Note: this applies whether the object is travelling in a full circle, or just a small arc of a circle. All that matters is that for a "snapshot"/moment-in-time, the object is trying to turn.
    - i.e. if I'm driving in a straight line, turn my steering wheel 10 degrees right for half a second, then return to driving straight, I have done "circular motion" / "centripetal acceleration" for however long my wheel was turned.





Note: centripetal force isn't a physical force (T, mg, f, N), it's a label we apply to whatever force(s) are making the object go in a circle.
