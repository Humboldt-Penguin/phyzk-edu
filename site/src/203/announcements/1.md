Hi all!

I made this website ([edu.phyzk.net](http://edu.phyzk.net/)) to put all my course info in a single spot.

You will never have to login/submit anything here, it's just a more easy/organized way to share and store information (compared to sending a bunch of emails).

## [1] Recitations / Labs

There are NO labs this week!

For recitation, I highly suggest looking over this page to prepare: [Week 5: Energy](../week/5.md){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }.

Additionally, I posted some [resources you might find helpful](../meta/resources.md){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }.

## [2] Study Sessions

I'll have study sessions on these dates:

|   Date    |        Time         | Location                           |
| :-------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------------------- |
| Wednesday | 04:00 PM - 07:00 PM | Busch > Physics Building > SRN-231 |
| Thursday  | 10:30 AM - 01:00 PM | Busch > Physics Building > SRN-231 |

??? info "How to find SRN-231"

    [Click here](../../hidden/SRN-231.md) for parking, entrance, and finding the room (especially if doors are locked).

Please come with questions!!! The practice exam(s) are a great place to start. I'm more than happy to teach an entire topic scratch, but it's easiest when I have some problems to work off of.
