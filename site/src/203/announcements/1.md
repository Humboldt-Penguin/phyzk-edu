Hi all!

I made this website ([edu.phyzk.net](http://edu.phyzk.net/)) to put all my course info in a single spot. You will never have to login/submit anything here, it's just a more easy/organized way to share and store information, compared to sending a bunch of emails.

## [1] Study Sessions

- link (please fill by Sunday night, or Monday as early as possible): https://forms.gle/oYwJuCs1wNhqd7v49
- come with questions!!!! in my past experience, i'm able to help most when students come to me and say "i'm struggling with these three problems on the practice exam, can we walk through them together?". I'm more than happy to teach the entire topic scratch, but it's easiest when I have some problems to work off of.
